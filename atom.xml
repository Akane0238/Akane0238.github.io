It comprises of:</p><ul><li><strong>a thread ID, TID</strong></li><li><strong>a program counter</strong></li><li><strong>a register set</strong></li><li><strong>a stack</strong><br>And it shares with other threads belonging to the <em>same process</em>:</li><li><strong>code</strong> section</li><li><strong>data</strong> section</li><li><strong>operating-system resources</strong> + open files (and other memory management information) + signals (ps: signal handlers are in shared code section)<br>A thread can also be viewed as a flow of control. A traditional process has a single thread of control.</li></ul><p>Since each thread executes independently, each thread has its own understanding of the stack and of the registers.<br><img src="/2024/12/03/Operating-System-Concepts-Ch4/layout.png" alt="layout.png"><br>The bad part is that unlike the protection that exists among processes, the operating system can not prevent threads from interfering with each other – they share the same process space.</p><h2 id="motivation"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#motivation"></a> Motivation</h2><p>The first question merges in mind is that - why we need to introduce the concept of <strong>thread</strong>?</p><p>A process may have some independent parts of execution which can be executed asynchronically. Take Web browser as an example, it might have one thread displaying images or text (renderer) while another thread retrieves data from network (across NIC), these are relatively different work and need few communication, which can be seen as <em>independent</em>.</p><p>A process might have to handle some duplicate requests. Think about a Web server, it may perform several similar tasks, such as accepting client request for web pages, images or videos. If the web server program runs as a traditional single-threaded process, it can serve only one client at any point since concurrency is not true <em>parellelism</em>! One solution to the problem is to create a separate new process to serve every client. But that’s huge resource consumption because creating a new process is time-consuming and resource-intensive (and we terminate it when task finishes), and it’s in low resource utilization because the process just performs the same tasks as the original process (say, search data in DB and return it to client).</p><p>So in this cirsumstance, why not just create a more lightweight process - thread?<br><img src="/2024/12/03/Operating-System-Concepts-Ch4/server.png" alt="server.png"></p><h2 id="benefits"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#benefits"></a> Benefits</h2><ul><li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> allowing program to continue running even if part of it is blocked or is performing a lengthy operation, thereby increasing reponsiveness to the user</li><li><strong>Resource sharing:</strong> sharing the memory and resources of the process to which they belong to, which allows an aplication to have several threads of activity within the same address space</li><li><strong>Economy:</strong> more economical to create and context-switch threads</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> threads can run in parellel on different processing cores, which takes advantage of muticores system</li></ul><h1 id="mechanism-of-thread-switching"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#mechanism-of-thread-switching"></a> Mechanism of Thread Switching</h1><p>Switching the CPU from one thread to another belonging to the same process involves suspending the current thread, saving its <em>state</em> (e.g., registers, accumulator), and then restoring the state of the thread being switched to.</p><p>The thread switch actually completes at the moment a new program counter is loaded into PC; at that point, the CPU is no longer executing the thread switching code, it is executing code associated with the new thread.</p><p>A context switch between threads does the following:</p><ol><li><strong>Save all registers</strong> (general-perpose, special and CCs) in TCB (Thread Control Block).</li><li>Then we will <strong>save PC</strong>. Instead of saving the current PC, we place the return address (found on the stack in the thread’s activation record) in the thread’s context block. When the thread is resumed later, the resuming address loaded into the PC will be the instruction immediately following the <code>call</code> instruction that invoked <code>Switch()</code> earlier.</li><li>Once the current thread’s state has been saved, <strong>load new values into the registers</strong> from the TCB of the next thread. We know that in the perspective of CPU, a context of a process or thread is all about the registers and condition codes (and maybe cache, but not consider here). So when a new stack pointer loaded onto SP, it actually performs “stack switching”.</li><li>So what is the exact point a context switch has taken place? That is, when the current PC is replaced by the saved PC found in the process table. Once the saved PC is loaded, <code>Switch()</code> is no longer executing; we are now executing instructions associated with the new thread, which should be the instruction immediately following the call to <code>Switch()</code>. <strong>As soon as the new PC is loaded, a context switch has taken place.</strong></li></ol><h1 id="multithreading-model"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#multithreading-model"></a> Multithreading Model</h1><h2 id="user-level-thread-and-kernel-level-thread"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#user-level-thread-and-kernel-level-thread"></a> User Level thread and Kernel Level thread</h2><p><strong>Support</strong> for threads may be provided eitherat the user level, for <strong>user threads</strong>, or by the kernel, for <strong>kernel threads</strong>. User threads are supported above the kernel and are managed without kernel support, whereas kernel threads are suported an managed directly by the operating system.</p><p>There are two confusing terms, one is “<em>support</em>” and the other is “<em>user/kernel thread</em>”.</p><p>To my understading, user level thread and kernel level thread are two abstract concepts. User threads are visible to user/programmer which means they can be manipulated by users. While kernel threads are visible to operating system, they are managed by kernel, and most importantly, they are the actual unit to be scheduled by kernel or to be executed by CPU.</p><p>So in order to make a user thread to be executed, a relationship must exist between user threads and kernel threads, that is <strong>mapping</strong>. The following are the three common ways to establish such a relationship.</p><h2 id="many-to-one-model"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#many-to-one-model"></a> Many-to-One Model</h2><p>The many-to-one model maps many user threads to a single kernel thread. Thread management (creation, termination, scheduling, etc) is implemented by <em>thread library</em>, so kernel is unaware of these threads and it can only “see” one user thread at any time.</p><p>This model is efficient since the management is all done in user level, without diving into kernel mode. However, if a thread calls a blocking system call (e.g. <code>sleep()</code>, <code>wait()</code> or I/O request), the entire process will block. Also, because only one thread can access the kernel at a time, it can’t make use of mutiple processors in muticores environment.<br><img src="/2024/12/03/Operating-System-Concepts-Ch4/many-to-one.png" alt="many-to-one.png"></p><h2 id="one-to-one-model"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#one-to-one-model"></a> One-to-One Model</h2><p>The one-to-one model maps each user thread to a kernel thread. It not only provides more concurrency by allowing another thread to run when a thread makes a blocking system call, but also allows mutiple threads to run in parallel in muticores environment.</p><p>The only drawback is that creating and manipulating a bunch of kernel threads bring a great overhead and can burden the performance of an application.<br><img src="/2024/12/03/Operating-System-Concepts-Ch4/one-to-one.png" alt="one-to-one.png"></p><h2 id="lightweight-process-lwp"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#lightweight-process-lwp"></a> Lightweight Process (LWP)</h2><p><em>Copy from <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu">https://cseweb.ucsd.edu</a></em></p><p>Kernel threads are great for kernel writers and user threads answer many of the needs of users, but they are not perfect. Consider these examples:</p><ul><li>On a multiprocessor system, only one thread within a process can execute at a time</li><li>A process that consists of many threads, each of which may be able to execute at any time, will not get any more CPU time than a process containing only one thread</li><li>If any thread within a process makes a system call, all threads within that process will be blocked because of the context switch.</li><li>If any user thread blocks waiting for I/O or a resource, the entire process blocks. (Thread libraries usually replace blocking calls with non-blocking calls whenever possible to mitigate this.)</li></ul><p>To address these needs, we need to have a kernel supported user thread. That is to say, we need a facility for threads to share resources within a process, but we also need the ability of the kernel to preempt, schedule, and dispatch threads. This type of thread is called a <em>kernel supported user thread</em> or a <em>light-weight process (LWP)</em>. A light-weight process is in contrast with a <em>heavy-weight process</em> otherwise known as a process or task.</p><p>Our model of the universe has gone from looking like this:<br><img src="/2024/12/03/Operating-System-Concepts-Ch4/old.png" alt="old.png"><br>To looking like this:<br><img src="/2024/12/03/Operating-System-Concepts-Ch4/new.png" alt="new.png"></p><p>To the user-thread library, the LWP appears to be a virtual processor on which the application can schedule a user thread to run. Each LWP is attached to a kernel thread, and <strong>it is kernel threads that the operating system schedules to run on physical processors</strong> (Ch 5.).<br><img src="/2024/12/03/Operating-System-Concepts-Ch4/lwp.png" alt="lwp.png"></p><h2 id="many-to-many-model"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#many-to-many-model"></a> Many-to-Many Model</h2><p>Based on LWPs, the many-to-many model mutiplexes many user-level threads to a smaller or equal number of kernel threads. Developers can create as many user threads as necessary, and the corresponding kernel threads can run in parallel on a mutiprocessor.<br><img src="/2024/12/03/Operating-System-Concepts-Ch4/many-to-many.png" alt="many-to-many.png"></p><h1 id="user-level-and-kernel-level-multithreading"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#user-level-and-kernel-level-multithreading"></a> User-level and Kernel-level Multithreading</h1><p>The key difference between <strong>explicitly user-level thread libraries</strong> (e.g., <code>pthread</code> or <code>windows.h</code>) and <strong>implicitly kernel-level thread abstractions</strong> (e.g., thread pools, OpenMP, or GCD) lies in <strong>control granularity</strong> and <strong>abstraction level</strong>, which affects <strong>how threads are managed</strong> and <strong>who is responsible for managing them</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-user-level-thread-libraries-explicit-control"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#1-user-level-thread-libraries-explicit-control"></a> 1. User-Level Thread Libraries (Explicit Control)</h3><p>Examples: <code>pthread</code> (POSIX threads), <code>windows.h</code> (Windows threading API)</p><h4 id="characteristics"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#characteristics"></a> Characteristics:</h4><ul><li><strong>Explicit Thread Management:</strong><br>The programmer directly creates, manages, and synchronizes threads using APIs like <code>pthread_create</code>, <code>pthread_join</code>, or <code>CreateThread</code>.</li><li><strong>Fine-Grained Control:</strong><br>The library exposes lower-level primitives, allowing the programmer to:<ul><li>Decide when and how to create threads.</li><li>Explicitly synchronize threads with mutexes, condition variables, etc.</li><li>Handle thread termination and resource cleanup.</li></ul></li><li><strong>User-Space Scheduling:</strong><br>If implemented as purely user-level threads (like in the Many-to-One model), the kernel may not even be aware of these threads, and the thread library handles scheduling in user space. This provides lightweight thread management but can suffer from blocking issues.</li></ul><h3 id="2-kernel-level-thread-libraries-implicit-abstractions"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#2-kernel-level-thread-libraries-implicit-abstractions"></a> 2. Kernel-Level Thread Libraries (Implicit Abstractions)</h3><p>Examples: Thread pools, OpenMP (<code>omp.h</code>), Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)</p><h4 id="characteristics-2"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#characteristics-2"></a> Characteristics:</h4><ul><li><strong>Higher-Level Abstractions:</strong><br>These libraries or frameworks hide most of the low-level thread management details from the programmer. <u>Instead of directly managing threads, you typically submit <strong>task</strong> or use <strong>parallel constructs</strong>, and the system determines how threads are allocated</u>.</li><li><strong>Kernel-Managed Threads:</strong><br>These abstractions often rely on kernel threads for execution, meaning the kernel scheduler handles thread creation, termination, and context switching.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Resource Management:</strong><br>They dynamically adjust thread usage to match the available hardware resources (e.g., CPU cores) and workload. For example:<ul><li><strong>Thread pools</strong> reuse threads to minimize thread creation and destruction overhead.</li><li><strong>OpenMP</strong> dynamically distributes work across threads with constructs like <code>#pragma omp parallel for</code>.</li><li><strong>GCD</strong> (on Apple platforms) uses queues to schedule tasks onto kernel threads efficiently.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="why-they-seem-the-same-to-programmers"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#why-they-seem-the-same-to-programmers"></a> Why They “Seem the Same” to Programmers</h3><p>From a usability perspective, they may feel similar because:</p><ol><li>Both allow concurrent execution.</li><li>The higher-level abstractions are designed to make concurrency <strong>easier</strong>, hiding the underlying complexity.</li></ol><p>However, the <strong>level of abstraction</strong> and <strong>degree of control</strong> are vastly different. If you’re using <code>pthread</code>, you’re <strong>explicitly</strong> in charge of the threads, while with something like OpenMP or GCD, you’re simply defining tasks, and the <strong>framework/library manages everything else</strong>.</p><hr><p><strong>Reference:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5440128/thread-context-switch-vs-process-context-switch">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5440128/thread-context-switch-vs-process-context-switch</a></li><li><a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~narten/110/nachos/main/node13.html">https://users.cs.duke.edu/~narten/110/nachos/main/node13.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9HHWFp84f0">Why Are Threads Needed On Single Core Processors - Core Dumped</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15983872/difference-between-user-level-and-kernel-supported-threads">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15983872/difference-between-user-level-and-kernel-supported-threads</a></li><li><a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp16/cse120-a/applications/ln/lecture4.html">https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp16/cse120-a/applications/ln/lecture4.html</a></li><li>ChatGPT-4o</li><li><em>Operating System Concepts, 9th edition</em></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="key-objectives"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#key-objectives"></a> Key objectives</h1><ul><li>To learn the notion wof a process - a program in execution.</li><li>To describe the various features of processes, including scheduling, creation, and termination.</li><li>To introduce interprocess communication using shared memory and message passing.</li></ul><h1 id="process-concept"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#process-concept"></a> Process Concept</h1><h2 id="1-the-process"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#1-the-process"></a> 1. The process</h2><p>Informally, a process can be considered as a program in execution. While a program is a <em>passive</em> entity (often called an <strong>executable file</strong>), a process is an <em>active</em> entity with a PC spcifying the next instruction to execute and a set of associated resources.</p><p>So what do we mean by the term “resources”? We know that a process is more than the program code, which is known as the <strong>text section</strong>, it also includes the current activity and the contents of the processor’s registers. A process also includes the runtime process <strong>stack</strong>, which contains temporary data, and a <strong>data section</strong>, which contains global variables, and a heap, which is memory that is dynamically allocated during process run time. Following diagram shows the structure of a process in memory:<img src="/2024/11/17/Operating-System-Concepts-Ch3/memory_diagram.png" alt="memory_diagram.png"></p><h2 id="2-process-state"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#2-process-state"></a> 2. Process state</h2><p>A process may be in one of the states:</p><ul><li><strong>New</strong>: The process is being created.</li><li><strong>Running</strong>: Instructions are being executed.</li><li><strong>Waiting</strong>: The process is waiting for some event to occur (such as an I/O completion).</li><li><strong>Ready</strong>: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.</li><li><strong>Terminated</strong>: The process has finished execution.<br><img src="/2024/11/17/Operating-System-Concepts-Ch3/diagram-of-process-state.jpg" alt="diagram-of-process-state.jpg"></li></ul><h2 id="3-process-control-block"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#3-process-control-block"></a> 3. Process Control Block</h2><p>In the foregoing text we mentioned the structure of process in memory, which I think is the <strong>“memory’s view”</strong> of the process. Each process is represented in the operating system by a <strong>process conrol block (PCB)</strong>, which I think is essentially a “scheduler’s view” of the process.</p><p>PCB holds the metadata necessary for the OS to manage the process, containing many pieces of information:</p><ul><li><strong>Process state</strong></li><li><strong>Program counter</strong></li><li><strong>CPU registers</strong></li><li><strong>CPU-scheduling information</strong> (Ch 5.)</li><li><strong>Memory-management information</strong> (Ch 8.)</li><li><strong>Accounting information</strong>: including the amount of CPU and real time used, time limits, account number, process numbers, etc</li><li><strong>I/O status information</strong>: the list of I/O devices allocated to the process, a list of files, etc</li></ul><p>So, while the process structure in memory <strong>reflects the actual memory layout and runtime environment</strong> of the process, the PCB serves as the <strong>abstracted record that the OS scheduler uses</strong> to manage and control process execution.</p><p>Here is a more detailed introduction of PCB: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/process-control-block-in-os/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/process-control-block-in-os/</a></p><h1 id="process-scheduling"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#process-scheduling"></a> Process Scheduling</h1><p>The objective of mutiprogramming is to have some process running at all times, to maximize CPU utilization. The objective of time sharing is to switch the CPU among processes to so frequently that users can interact with each program while it is running. To meet this objectives, the <strong>process scheduler</strong> selects an available process for program execution on the CPU.</p><h2 id="1-scheduling-queue"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#1-scheduling-queue"></a> 1. Scheduling queue</h2><p>Scheduling queue is the place where a process will be selected for execution. A common representation of process scheduling is a queueing diagram:<img src="/2024/11/17/Operating-System-Concepts-Ch3/queuing-diagram.png" alt="queuing-diagram.png"></p><h2 id="2-scheduler"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#2-scheduler"></a> 2. Scheduler</h2><p>The selection process we mentioned is carried out by the appropriate scheduler. Typically, there are two types of schedulers: <strong>long-term scheduler</strong> and <strong>short-term scheduler</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>long-term scheduler (job scheduler)</strong>: selects processes from the pool and loads them into memory</li><li><strong>short-term scheduler (CPU scheduler)</strong>: selects from among the processes that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to one of them</li></ul><p>It is important that the long-term scheduler select a god <em>process mix</em> of <strong>I/O-bound process</strong> and <strong>CPU-bound process</strong>, to make maximized utilization of CPU and other peripherals.</p><h1 id="operations-on-processes"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#operations-on-processes"></a> Operations on Processes</h1><h2 id="1-process-creation-forkexec"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#1-process-creation-forkexec"></a> 1. Process creation: <code>fork()</code>&amp;<code>exec()</code></h2><p>When a process creates a new process, it invokes <code>fork()</code> system call, then two processes will exist: the parent and the child. They each have their own independent memory space, <strong>created as a duplicate of the parent process’s memory image at the time of the <code>fork()</code>.</strong> So, while they initially share the same memory contents, they don’t share the same memory space—any changes in the memory of one process do not affect the other.</p><p>The <code>exec()</code> system call replaces the current process’s memory with a new program. When a process (either the parent or the child) calls <code>exec()</code>, it loads the specified binary executable into its own memory space, overwriting the existing program code, stack, heap, and data segments. This effectively “destroys” the memory image of the process that existed before the <code>exec()</code> call and replaces it with a new one.</p><p>This replacement doesn’t affect the other process, though:</p><ol><li><strong>Independent Memory Spaces:</strong> After <code>fork()</code>, the parent and child processes have separate memory spaces. So when the child (or the parent) calls <code>exec()</code>, it only affects that process’s memory, not the other’s.</li><li><strong>Process Continuation After <code>exec()</code>:</strong> After calling <code>exec()</code>, the process (now with a new memory image) continues execution at the entry point of the new program, rather than the program that was previously running. It can still execute because the <code>exec()</code> call replaces the memory but not the process ID (PID). The process itself persists, but its memory contents are now those of the new program.</li></ol><h2 id="2-process-termiation-waitexit"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#2-process-termiation-waitexit"></a> 2. Process termiation: <code>wait()</code>&amp;<code>exit()</code></h2><p>A process terminates when it finishes executing its final statement and asks the operating system to delete it by using the <code>exit()</code> system call. At hat point, the process may return a status value to its parent proess (via the <code>wait()</code> system call).</p><p>After the <code>exit()</code> sys call, all the resources of the process—including physical and virtual memory, open files, and I/O buffers—are deallocated by the operating system. However, it entry in the process table must remain there until the parent calls <code>wait()</code>, because the process table contains the process’s exit status.</p><h1 id="interprocess-communication"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#interprocess-communication"></a> Interprocess Communication</h1><p>Cooperating processes require an <strong>interprocess communicaton (IPC)</strong> mechanism that will allow them to exchange data and information with each other. There are two fundamental models of IPC: <strong>shared-memory</strong> and <strong>message-passing</strong>.</p><h2 id="1-shared-memory-model"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#1-shared-memory-model"></a> 1. Shared-memory model</h2><p>In this IPC Model, a shared memory region is established which is used by the processes for data communication. This memory region is <strong>present in the address space of the process which creates the shared memory segment</strong>. The processes that want to communicate with this process should <strong>attach this memory segment to their address space</strong>.</p><p>Here’s a basic outline of how shared memory IPC operates:</p><ul><li><strong>Creation of Shared Memory Segment:</strong> A process usually the parent, creates a shared memory segment using the system calls like <code>shmget()</code> in Unix-like systems. This segment is assigned the unique identifier (<code>shmid</code>).</li><li><strong>Attaching to the Shared Memory Segment:</strong> The Processes that need to access the shared memory attach themselves to this segment using <code>shmat()</code> system call. Once attached the processes can directly read from and write to the shared memory.</li><li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> Since multiple processes can access the shared memory simultaneously synchronization mechanisms like semaphores are often used to the <strong>prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency</strong>.</li><li><strong>Detaching and Deleting the Segment:</strong> When a process no longer needs access to the shared memory it can detach from the segment using <code>shmdt()</code> system call. The shared memory segment can be removed entirely from system using <code>shmctl()</code> once all processes have the detached.</li></ul><h2 id="2-message-passing-model"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#2-message-passing-model"></a> 2. Message-passing model</h2><p>Message passing provides a mechanism to allow processes to communicate and to synchronize their actions without sharing the same address space. A message-passing facility provides at least two operations: <code>send(message)</code>and<code>receive(message)</code>. To satisfy these purposes, a <em>logical communication link</em> is needed.</p><p>Although the message queue is not maintained by the processes but the kernel, synchronization problem still exists. There are two types of implements: <code>sychronous message passing (blocking)</code> and <code>asynchronous message passing (non-blocking)</code>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Shared Memory Model</th><th>Message Passing Model</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The shared memory region is used for communication.</td><td>A message-passing facility is used for communication.</td></tr><tr><td>It is used for communication between processes on a single processor or multiprocessor system where the communicating processes reside on the same machine as the communicating processes share a common address space.</td><td>It is typically used in a distributed environment where communicating processes reside on remote machines connected through a network.</td></tr><tr><td>The code for reading and writing the data from the shared memory should be written explicitly by the Application programmer.</td><td>No such code is required here as the message-passing facility provides a mechanism for communication and synchronization of actions performed by the communicating processes.</td></tr><tr><td>It provides a maximum speed of computation as communication is done through shared memory so system calls are made only to establish the shared memory.</td><td>It is time-consuming as message passing is implemented through kernel intervention (system calls).</td></tr><tr><td>Here the processes need to ensure that they are not writing to the same location simultaneously.</td><td>It is useful for sharing small amounts of data as conflicts need not be resolved.</td></tr><tr><td>Faster communication strategy.</td><td>Relatively slower communication strategy.</td></tr><tr><td>No kernel intervention.</td><td>It involves kernel intervention.</td></tr><tr><td>It can be used in exchanging larger amounts of data.</td><td>It can be used in exchanging small amounts of data.</td></tr><tr><td>Example- <br><br>- Data from a client process may need to be transferred to a server process for modification before being returned to the client.</td><td>Example- <br><br>- Web browsers<br>- Web Servers<br>- Chat program on WWW (World Wide Web)</td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id="communication-in-client-server-system"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#communication-in-client-server-system"></a> Communication in Client-Server system</h1><h2 id="1-sockets"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#1-sockets"></a> 1. Sockets</h2><p>Sockets are designed to provide <strong>low-level communication mechanisms</strong>. They are (1) Closer to the network layer and (2) more flexible but require more work from the developer to interpret the data.</p><h3 id="whats-the-format-of-data-in-connection-between-sockets"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#whats-the-format-of-data-in-connection-between-sockets"></a> What’s the format of data in connection between sockets</h3><p>We define sockets with the term <strong>&quot;low-level &quot;</strong> because sockets provide a way to send and receive <strong>raw data</strong> (byte streams). It is up to the developer to define the meaning, structure, and interpretation of these bytes. Sockets do not impose any structure on the data; they only transport it as an <strong>unstructed stream of bytes</strong>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="前言"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#前言"></a> 前言</h1><p>上半年搭建完博客后初步了解了一下 git 的常用指令，第一次了解 git 这个版本控制工具，之后又零零散散地通过不同慕课和视频（<em><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1x7411H7wa/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0">Missing semester</a></em>，<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Bu4y1K7yr/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0">南大 ICS</a>和<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1r3411F7kn/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0">技术蛋老师</a>）重温，可是我发现在学习过程中并没有很深入地去了解 git 的相关概念和具体操作之间的关系，实际使用中还涉及与远端仓库的交互，因此在做实验时总是搞得一团乱麻 (screw up)。学艺不精最终在实践中带来恶果，其中种种因缘和合且按下不表。最终我在痛定思痛后决心开启新周目的 git 学习，希望能真正地<strong>了解</strong>git，以后遇到问题不至于连 CSDN 的解决方法都看不懂。</p><h1 id="学习内容"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#学习内容"></a> 学习内容</h1><p>这次的学习的参考资料主要是 <em>Pro Git</em>，并且注重学习其中的具体概念。本篇博文会补充在一周目博文中没有记录的 command，同时通过具体实操例子来阐述 git 的概念与操作。</p><blockquote><p>… , because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. —— <em>Pro Git</em></p></blockquote><h1 id="什么是-git"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#什么是-git"></a> 什么是 Git</h1><h2 id="使用-snapshot-而非-δ"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#使用-snapshot-而非-δ"></a> 使用 snapshot 而非 Δ</h2><p>git 和其他 VCS (Version Control System)最大的区别就在于它们是如何对待 (think of)数据的。</p><p>绝大部分的 VCS 存储的文件以及不同版本间对这些文件进行的修改 (<strong><em>delta-based</em></strong> version control)。Store data as a series of <strong>changesets</strong>。<img src="/2024/10/02/Git%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%A8%E7%9B%AE%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/changes.png" alt="changes.png"><br>相较之下，git 认为数据是一个微型文件系统中的一系列快照 (snapshot)。Store data as a series of <strong>snapshots</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>Git thinks about its data more like a <strong>stream of snapshots</strong>.<br><img src="/2024/10/02/Git%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%A8%E7%9B%AE%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/snapshot.png" alt="snapshot.png"></p></blockquote><h2 id="commit-与-snapshot"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#commit-与-snapshot"></a> commit 与 snapshot</h2><blockquote><p><strong>When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged.</strong> This object also contains the author’s name and email address, the message that you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent or parents): zero parents for the initial commit, one parent for a normal commit, and multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.</p></blockquote><p>snapshot 是一种当前项目状态的一种抽象，实际上我们的 fies 以树的形式 (tree object)存储在 repo 中。我们提交到 repo 中的 commit 包含一些元数据 ([[#^ce9b5c|meta data]])以及一个指向树的根节点的指针。</p><blockquote><p>Staging the files computes a checksum for each one, stores that version of the file in the Git repository (Git refers to them as <em>blobs</em>), and adds that checksum to the staging area.</p><p>When you create the commit by running git commit, Git checksums each subdirectory and stores them as a <strong>tree object</strong> in the Git repository. Git then creates a commit object that has the metadata and a pointer to the root project tree so it can re-create that snapshot when needed.</p></blockquote><p><img src="/2024/10/02/Git%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%A8%E7%9B%AE%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/commit_tree.png" alt="commit_tree.png"></p><h2 id="git-的数据完整性"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#git-的数据完整性"></a> Git 的数据完整性</h2><p>所有记录在 git 中的数据都会使用哈希算法 (SHA-1)进行检验和处理，然后才根据哈希值将数据记录在 git 中，这也意味着不可能在不被 git 记录的情况下修改其中的文件。–&gt; integrity</p><blockquote><p>You can’t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it.</p></blockquote><h2 id="三种-git-追踪的文件状态重要"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#三种-git-追踪的文件状态重要"></a> 三种 git 追踪的文件状态（重要）</h2><p>git 追踪 (tracking)的文件有三种状态：<em>modified, staged and committed</em></p><ul><li><em>modified</em> 意味着对文件做了修改但是还没有 commit 到数据库 (local or remote)中</li><li><em>staged</em> 意味着标记已修改的文件并且可以 commit 其当前版本</li><li><em>committed</em> 指文件已经安全地存储在了本地数据库中<br><img src="/2024/10/02/Git%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%A8%E7%9B%AE%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/status.png" alt="status.png"><br>三种状态也对应着三个概念：<em>working tree, staging area and Git repository</em></li><li><u>The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. </u>These files are pulled out of the <strong>compressed</strong> database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.</li><li><u>The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory</u>, that stores information about what will go into your next commit.</li><li><u>The Git directory is where Git stores the <b>metadata</b> and object database</u> for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and <strong>it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.</strong> (ps: 文中所说的&quot;metadata&quot;可以理解为对数据的存放、访问、处理等操作的规则，可以联想 HTML 的&lt;head&gt;中的&lt;meta&gt; tag，以及类比于磁盘管理中的 MBR) ^ce9b5c</li></ul><p>基于这三种状态，我们可以运行一条标准（常见）的工作流：</p><ol><li>在当前的工作目录下修改文件</li><li>通过<code>add</code>来选择性地将文件加入到暂存区中，准备提交</li><li>将暂存区的文件提交到本地仓库，并且永久地记录下它的快照（记住我们是通过 hash value 来对 snapshot 进行唯一标识的）</li></ol><h1 id="git-基础"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#git-基础"></a> Git 基础</h1><h2 id="tracked-staged-and-untracked"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#tracked-staged-and-untracked"></a> Tracked, Staged and Untracked</h2><p>前面说“git 追踪的文件有三种状态”，其中追踪就是指 tracked，顾名思义 git 能够知道文件是否做了更改 (changes)。<u>实际上，git 目录下的文件只有两种状态，tracked or untracked</u>。对于 untracked files 来说，我们通过<code>git add</code>来将它们推到暂存区中，此时的 snapshot 加入了此次变动，所以它们<strong>暂时</strong>也是 staged 状态（当然也是 tracked）。但是如果我们对它们进行修改，那么这些 tracked 文件的修改会被 git 追踪，但并没有将 changes 更新到 staging area 的 snapshot 中，所以此时我们 commit 的话将是把未更新的 snapshot 永久记录在 git log 中。为了更新 snapshot 中的文件版本，我们在修改后还需要<code>git add</code>重新 staging。</p><blockquote><p>Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn’t have in the previous snapshot (commit), and which hasn’t yet been staged.</p><p><code>git add</code> is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin <strong>tracking new files</strong>, to <strong>stage files</strong>, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. It may be helpful to think of it more as “<u>add precisely this content to the next commit</u>” rather than “add this file to the project”.</p></blockquote><p><img src="/2024/10/02/Git%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%A8%E7%9B%AE%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/git_status.png" alt="git_status.png"></p><h2 id="ignoring-files"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#ignoring-files"></a> Ignoring Files</h2><p>有时候我们的工作目录中会有一些我们不想提交的文件，例如编译中间过程产生的<code>.o</code>文件、日志等，而它们又总是会出现在<code>Untracked files</code>下，为了让 git 忽略它们，我们可以创建一个<code>.gitignore</code>隐藏文件。<code>.gitignore</code>中写的是你需要忽略的文件名，当然可以使用通配符 (glob pattern)的形式。下面是一个例子：</p><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta prompt_">$ </span><span class="language-bash"><span class="built_in">cat</span> .gitignore</span></span><br><span class="line">*.[oa]</span><br><span class="line">*~</span><br><span class="line">a.txt</span><br><span class="line">build/</span><br><span class="line">!hello.o</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="git-diff"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#git-diff"></a> git diff</h2><blockquote><p>you’ll probably use it most often to answer these two questions: <strong>What have you changed but not yet staged? And what have you staged that you are about to commit?</strong></p></blockquote><p>不同于<code>git status</code>只给出哪些文件做了修改，<code>git diff</code>能更详细地给出文件中增加或删除的文本行，这些是做了修改但是含没有暂存的文件。我们知道，<code>git diff</code>比较的是<u>工作目录下的文件和暂存区中的文件</u>，所以记得要在修改后要更新 snapshot，才会更新文件的 version。<br><img src="/2024/10/02/Git%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%A8%E7%9B%AE%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/diff.png" alt="diff.png"></p><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta prompt_">$ </span><span class="language-bash">git diff --staged</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>加上 option<code>--staged</code>则会比较暂存区文件和上一次 commit 的区别，注意看<code>hello.cc</code>文件的版本是还没有更新的，还是暂存区中的旧版本。<br><img src="/2024/10/02/Git%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%A8%E7%9B%AE%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/diff_staged.png" alt="diff_staged.png"><br>要注意，<code>git diff</code>这个命令本身只比较修改后的 unstaged 文件和 staged 文件间的区别，而不会显示它们与上一次 commit 的区别！</p><h2 id="git-rm"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#git-rm"></a> git rm</h2><p><code>git rm</code>将文件从 working directory 中删除，同时 stage changes。在下图的情况中，如果我们此时 commit，那么 history 中的 snapshot 将不再有<code>hello</code>文件，但是<code>b.txt</code>还是存在的，因为 git 并没有记录该文件的改变 (deletion)。</p><blockquote><p>You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the <code>git rm</code> command.</p></blockquote><p><img src="/2024/10/02/Git%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%A8%E7%9B%AE%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/git_rm.png" alt="git_rm.png"><br>既然<code>git add</code>可以使文件 untracked --&gt; tracked，当我们不小心 add 了不希望提交的文件，我们也可以将其从 tracked 状态转变为 untracked 状态：</p><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta prompt_">$ </span><span class="language-bash">git <span class="built_in">rm</span> --cached filename</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><img src="/2024/10/02/Git%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%A8%E7%9B%AE%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/rm_cached.png" alt="rm_cached.png"></p><h2 id="undoing-things"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#undoing-things"></a> Undoing Things</h2><h3 id="1-修订上次的提交"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#1-修订上次的提交"></a> 1. 修订上次的提交</h3><p>如果我们在 commit 后发现有些更改忘记 stage 了，可以加上 option<code>--amend</code>来修正</p><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta prompt_">$ </span><span class="language-bash">git commit -m <span class="string">&quot;my first commit&quot;</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta prompt_">$ </span><span class="language-bash">git add CNAME.txt</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta prompt_">$ </span><span class="language-bash">git commit --amend</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="2-将-staged-转为-unstaged"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#2-将-staged-转为-unstaged"></a> 2. 将 staged 转为 unstaged</h3><p>我们可能通过<code>git add *</code>不小心暂存了我们不想在下次 commit 的文件，为了将其从暂存区中解救出来，需要下面的命令（其实这在 header 中有写）：</p><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta prompt_"># </span><span class="language-bash">showed <span class="keyword">in</span> status bar, better    √</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta prompt_">$ </span><span class="language-bash">git restore --staged filename</span></span><br><span class="line">or</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta prompt_"># </span><span class="language-bash">old version: wrote <span class="keyword">in</span> _Pro git_ ×</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta prompt_">$ </span><span class="language-bash">git reset HEAD filename</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>注意它和上文提到的解除追踪状态 tracked --&gt; untracked 之间的区别！</p><h3 id="3-撤销对文件的修改"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#3-撤销对文件的修改"></a> 3. 撤销对文件的修改</h3><p>如果要对做了修改的文件进行回退 (unmodify)，可以<code>git restore</code>，当然这也是在 header 中有提示的。<br>不过这个命令还是要慎重使用</p><blockquote><p>It’s important to understand that <code>git restore filename</code> is a dangerous command.

operations nearly instantaneous, and switching back and forth between branches generally just as fast.</p></blockquote><p>回顾一下我们对 commit 和 snapshot 的讨论，如果我们有许多 commits，那么它们在一个分支上将形成一个链表（头插入）。<img

cleanly。</p></blockquote><p>如果两个分支对同一个文件的同一位置做了修改，git 不知道以哪一分支的修改作为最终版本，所以会报错：<img src="/2024/10/02/Git%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%A8%E7%9B%AE%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/merge_conflict.png"

The <code>TCPReceiver</code> translates between incoming TCP segments (the payloads of datagrams carried over the Internet) and the incoming byte stream.</p><p>The <code>TCPReceiver</code> receives segments from the Internet (via the <code>segment received()</code>method) and turns them into calls to your StreamReassembler, which eventually writes to the incoming ByteStream.

0.</strong> The job of TCP is to convey two ByteStreams (one in each direction) over an unreliable datagram network, so that bytes written to the socket on one side of the connection emerge as bytes that can be read at the peer, and vice versa. <strong>Lab 1 is the StreamReassembler, and in Labs 2, 3, and 4 you’ll implement the TCPReceiver, TCPSender, and then the TCPConnection to tie it all together.</strong></p></blockquote><p>整个实验将 TCP 模块化分开来完成，最后把几个组件合在一起实现 TCP。在<code>Lab 0</code>的<code>webget</code>函数中，我们直接使用了系统提供的 TCP（<code>&quot;using Linux’s built-in implementation of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)&quot;</code>），在此之上我们使用 TCP 提供的服务实现了客户端<code>socket</code>。而接下来我们把视角移动到 socket 面向运输层的一端，将实现自己的 TCP，也就是说我们要<strong>在一个不可靠的网络（网络层）上实现对上层（应用层）提供的服务</strong>。</p><blockquote><p><strong>Over the next four weeks, you’ll implement TCP, to provide the byte-stream abstraction between a pair of computers

sequence.</p></blockquote><p>在<code>Lab 1</code>中，我们将要完成一个流重组器（stream reassembler），在上面的框架中可以看到它是我们实现<code>TCPReceiver</code>组件的一个子组件，其功能也很清晰：由于网络不可靠，所以数据报可能丢失、失序或者重复（没有考虑出错），流重组器读取这些数据报并将它们转换为可靠的字节流，写入<code>BytesSream</code>中。</p><h1 id="编写代码和调试"><a

C++不熟练，很多容器都不了解），我看网上有些朋友使用<code>std::vertor</code>，也有选<code>std::set</code>模拟缓冲区的，还有选<code>std::map</code>的。我选择的是<code>std::map</code>，<code>key</code>是<code>size_t</code>类型而<code>value</code>是<code>string</code>类对象，好像运用不到前面无端联想的东西。不得不说<code>map</code>进行合并实在是太繁琐了，要考虑到很多种情况（重复代码也很多），暴力模拟了 200 多行 😭，包含了整整 5 层条件判断 😭。由于太多种情况需要分析了，难免会有疏漏，最后我实在不想修补了，于是便放弃了<code>map</code>。后面我一想，直接每一个序号对应一个字节不久简单很多了吗！！</p><p>看到其他人三四十行就解决了，而我两百行写了一整天，感觉自己真的很菜。当然优化是后话了，至少先把实验完成了，再去考虑减少重复代码（函数封装），提高性能（选择其他数数据结构）等问题。</p><h2

src="/2024/08/11/CS144-Lab1/capacity.png" alt="capacity.png"></li><li><strong>注意：</strong> 接受到的子字符串可能是乱序、重复的，就如同实际网络中一样。这里的有一些注意点是实验文档里没说清楚的（不足之处），我通过调试测试用例才发现的（面向测试用例编程 😵）。<ul><li>子字符串可能完全位于蓝色/绿色（已读出/已写入<code>ByteStream</code>）部分，需要直接丢掉</li><li>子字符串可能有一部分是已经写入<code>ByteStream</code>（绿色），而有一部分是未写入的（红色），需要进行裁剪</li><li>子字符串可能全是红色部分，实验要求我们在红色部分不能有重叠的字符串，也就是说读入的时候我们要对它进行合并才能缓存到<code>Reassembler</code>中</li><li>字符串可能是包含<code>EOF</code>信息的空字符串，关键在<code>EOF</code>的处理</li></ul></li></ul><h2

的&quot;abc&quot;子字符串，直接缓存到<code>ByteStream</code>中，下一个期待接受到的序号应该是 3。之后再输入序号为 6 的&quot;ghX&quot;字符串，且最后一个字节是字符串流的末尾，由于前面还有字节未接收到，因此先缓存到<code>Reassembler</code>的缓冲区中。之后又输入了序号为 2 的字符串&quot;cdefg&quot;，由于序号 2 的字节已经写入<code>ByteSream</code>了，所以我们会对字符串进行裁剪，相当于输入的是序号为 3 的字符串&quot;defg&quot;。注意到此时缓冲区中有已重组的字符串&quot;abc&quot;+未重组的字符串&quot;ghX&quot;，剩余内存大小为 2，也就是说我们只能缓存序号为 3

只要求我们建立客户端的 socket，并和给定的目的主机<code>host</code>进行连接。我们知道建立 TCP 连接需要三次握手（three-way handshake），但我们在 socket 面向应用层的这端不需要显示地对三次握手进行编程，因为这个过程交由我们的操作系统隐式完成了。不仅如此，很多轮子官方也给我们搓好了，需要我们读一下<code>/libsponge/util</code>目录下的类接口（完成 webget 需要了解<code>address.hh</code>、<code>socket.hh</code>），也可以看<a

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>读罢《张居正》的第二卷，我发现这一卷的书名并没有很明确地在书中进行解析。第一卷所题“木兰歌”确是在卷末由玉娘为饯别高拱而在筵席上所弹唱的曲子《木兰歌》所提到，这首词精炼地<strong>概括</strong>了整卷书的内容，即张居正高拱两个大权力集团间的斗争。</p><blockquote><p>世上事一半儿荒唐一半儿险恶，<br>皇城中尔虞我诈，衙门内铁马金戈。<br>羽扇纶巾，说是些大儒大雅，<br>却为何我揪着你，你撕着我，<br>制陷阱、使绊子，一个比一个更利索。<br>呜呼！今日里拳头上跑马抖威风，<br>到明日败走麦城，<br>只落得形影相吊英雄泪滂沱。<br>只可叹，荣辱兴衰转瞬间。<br>天涯孤旅，古道悲风，<br>都在唱那一个字：<br>错！错！！错！！！    ——《张居正 第一卷：木兰歌》</p></blockquote><p>第二卷书围绕“胡椒苏木折俸”一事展开，讲述的是张居正当上首辅而进行“京察”改革以及过程中遇到的许多阻力（高拱门人捣乱、与李太后冯保等人的权力制衡…）。关于第二卷名《水龙吟》，我在读之前便在想作者要以一种什么手法来带出这个名字，遗憾的是读完也没能理解这三个字（我的文学水平太低了…）。首先我对这个词牌名不太了解，只读过几首这个词牌的词，一般每个词牌名都会有它名字的<strong>来源</strong>。</p><blockquote><p>据说，<u>“水龙吟”最早是南北朝时北齐的一组古琴曲</u>，据《北齐书》卷二十九“郑述祖传”：“述祖能鼓琴，自造《龙吟十弄》，云尝梦人弹琴，寤而写得。当时以为绝妙。”同时，<u>汉马融《长笛赋》云：“近世羌笛从羌起，羌人伐竹未及已。龙吟水中不见己，截竹吹之声相似。”故人们也以龙吟喻笛声</u>，如南朝梁<a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%98%E5%AD%9D%E5%85%88/3844125?fromModule=lemma_inlink">刘孝先</a>《咏竹诗》：“谁能制长笛，当为吐龙吟。”南北朝诗人<a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%BA%BE%E4%BF%A1/543904?fromModule=lemma_inlink">庾信</a>《对酒诗》：“惟有龙吟笛，桓伊能独吹。”  ——百度百科</p></blockquote><p>古琴、笛，无论哪个说法都和音乐有关，整本书关于音乐的描写不多，一部分笔墨描写的是李太后昭宁寺敬香时所奏的佛乐，一部分笔墨用来写窑子青楼里的声色犬马，很明显这些都和整卷书的主题无关。因此可以断言作者取《水龙吟》一名<strong>并非是从词牌名起源中的到灵感</strong>。</p><p>那么考虑这个<strong>词牌常用来表达什么主题</strong>。“它（《水龙吟》）是词牌名，宜用以抒写激奋情思，气势雄浑，正应了第二部的基调。”这个百度搜出来第一个关于标题含义的观点我不全认可。首先关于词牌是否“宜用以抒写激奋情思”：我读过的词不多，一首是辛弃疾的《登建康赏心亭》，一首是苏轼的《次韵章质夫杨花词》，一首是秦观的《小楼连苑横空》，这几首词都不是很奋进向上、激昂卓越的，<strong>反而是有一种空有抱负而无法施展的落寞感伤</strong>。再者关于这卷书的基调：这卷书讲张居正刚上任首辅一把手便想大做改革，实现强国富民的理想，这确实很“激奋”，但谈不上所谓“气势雄浑”。因为张居正新官上任，要面对的是隆庆一朝多年积弊，而且要实现自己的伟大抱负，对外要处理好和其他官员政党的关系，对内还要看着李太后的“皇权”眼色行事，纵使心中理想澎湃，但张居正还是受到许多挫折与打击，再说“激奋”其实已经太过了。</p><p>我猜测作者应该是<strong>取意于某首《水龙吟》</strong>。苏轼《次韵章质夫杨花词》中《水龙吟》的“水”是离人之泪，辛弃疾《登建康赏心亭》中《水龙吟》的“水”是英雄之泪，这两首《水龙吟》应该大家比较耳熟能详，如果真如我所猜的那样（这样普罗大众也都能理解），那标题必然是取意自后者。</p><blockquote><p>楚天千里清秋，水随天去秋无际。遥岑远目，献愁供恨，玉簪螺。落日楼头，断鸿声里，江南游子。把吴钩看了，栏杆拍遍，无人会，登临意。</p><p>休说鲈鱼堪脍，尽西风，季鹰归未？求田问舍，怕应羞见，刘郎才气。可惜流年，忧愁风雨，树犹如此！倩何人唤取，红巾翠袖，揾英雄泪！  ——辛弃疾《水龙吟·登建康赏心亭》</p></blockquote><p>分析这首词主旨大意（梦回中学），我们知道：全词通过写景和联想抒写了作者（辛弃疾）恢复中原国土，统一祖国的<strong>抱负和愿望无法实现的失意的感慨</strong>，深刻揭示了英雄志士<strong>有志难酬、报国无门、抑郁悲愤的苦闷心情</strong>，极大地表现了词人诚挚无私的爱国情怀。</p><p>透过这首词看张居正，他不就是彼时的辛弃疾吗！面对京察过程中“忧愁风雨”般的种种阻力，张居正有许多愁苦，但都一一化解。纵使辛弃疾把栏杆拍遍，也没有办法实现他的报国理想。但张居正不同，他作为大明首辅一人之下万人之上，有实权在握，心中的宏伟理想也能一步步实现，只不过需要步步为营以及沉着应对各种变数。</p><p>清代谭献在《谭评词辩》评价稼轩《水龙吟》：“裂竹之声，何尝不潜气内转”，在第二卷《水龙吟》中张居正不正如词评所说“潜气内转”吗？期待第三卷中张居正会如何把握朝政，开创“万历新政”。</p><hr><p>不过这第三卷恐怕得考完试才能看了，现在要面对的是严酷的<strong>期末学习周</strong>！！！TAT😭</p>]]></content>

摘要：</h3><p>由《庄子》首篇《逍遥游》中的蜩鸠之笑与小大之辩，联想到对时空维度的讨论，引发对哲学与科学二者关系的思考。我们能否以自然科学的思想来解释哲学呢？为了解决问题，探讨自然辩证法在学习古代哲学思想上的应用。自然辩证法揭示了自然科学发展的内在逻辑、人对自然界的能动关系等，它不但把科学看作是一种独立的社会现象,探讨其在一定社会中发展和发挥作用的规律，而且也把与科学紧密相关的技术作为一种独立的社会现象来研究。剖析庄子思想的两个组成部分——道论和德论，我们以现代视角来认知庄子道家思想。</p><h3 id="关键词自然辩证法-科学技术-庄子哲学"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#关键词自然辩证法-科学技术-庄子哲学"></a> 关键词：自然辩证法、科学技术、庄子哲学</h3><h2 id="一-从逍遥游看时空维度"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#一-从逍遥游看时空维度"></a> 一、从《逍遥游》看时空维度</h2><blockquote><p>蜩与学鸠笑之曰：“我决起而飞，抢榆枋而止，时则不至，而控于地而已矣，奚以之九万里而南为？”适莽苍者，三餐而反，腹犹果然；适百里者，宿舂粮；适千里者，三月聚粮。之二虫又何知！<strong>小知不及大知，小年不及大年。</strong> 奚以知其然也？朝菌不知晦朔，蟪蛄不知春秋，此小年也。楚之南有冥灵者，以五百岁为春，五百岁为秋；上古有大椿者，以八千岁为春，八千岁为秋。此大年也。而彭祖乃今以久特闻，众人匹之，不亦悲乎？——《逍遥游篇》</p></blockquote><p>《逍遥游》作为内篇中的第一篇，为读者阐明了庄子思想中的**“逍遥”** 。“逍遥游”是庄子的人生理想，是庄子人生论的核心内容。“逍遥游”在老子心中是“无所待而游无穷”，是对世俗之物无所依赖，与自然化而为一，不受任何束缚自由地游于世间之“逍遥”。“逍遥”，在庄子这里是指人超越了世俗观念及其价值的限制而达到的最大的精神自由。“游”，并不是指形体之游，更重要的是指精神之游，形体上的束缚被消解后，自然就可以悠游于世。逍遥游就是超脱万物、无所依赖、绝对自由的精神境界。</p><blockquote><p>“夫小大虽殊，而放于自得之场，则物任其性，事称其能，各当其分，逍遥一也，岂容胜负于其间哉！”——郭象《庄子注》</p></blockquote><p>庄子在论述“小大之辩”时，庄子提出分论点——“小知不及大知，小年不及大年”，并举朝菌、蟪蛄、冥灵、大椿和彭祖为例阐明观点，表明庄子内心无己、无功、无名的追求。</p><p>暂且跳出哲学思维而以自然科学的角度来看蜩鸠间的讨论。我们通常认知里的三维空间的三个维度里并没有<strong>时间</strong>。有些人认为四维空间比三维多出来的一个维度便是“时间”，也有些人认为一至三维空间都是在“时间”这个常变量下构造的。在我朴素的科学认知看来，时间算得上一个<strong>维度</strong>，但绝非“第四维”，而是与最低的一维空间所在维度并列的一个维度。若以爱因斯坦相对论的视角看，时间和空间本是相依相生的，不可能将时空分割开来讨论，更说把时间作为一个单独的“高维”。</p><p>回到《逍遥游》中来。朝菌朝生暮死，如蚍蜉般在世间匆匆游过，在它自己看来世界不过是一次日升月出、潮汐涨落。不严谨地来说，它所处的时间维度太低了，所以它无法感知高维时间的事物，自然也不知道什么是春夏秋冬，什么是每月的晦朔。</p><p>在思考庄子之“道”时，我一直以一种科学的视角来注视，去感受分析。在此过程中，我遇到了许多两者间的联系和冲突，自然也提出了一个问题：<strong>能否以自然科学的思想来解释哲学呢？</strong></p><h2 id="二-自然辩证法与南华哲思"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#二-自然辩证法与南华哲思"></a> 二、 自然辩证法与南华哲思</h2><p>要找到上面问题的答案，我们或许还应先回答另一个问题：<strong>科学与哲学的联系与区别是什么</strong>。</p><p>科学与哲学的本质区别在于，哲学是研究思维和存在，意识和物质的关系，主要通过思考来研究；科学是研究物质与其存在形式的关系，主要通过实验或调查验证来研究。科学研究当然需要思维和意识，<u>但它不研究思维和意识与物质存在的关系</u>；哲学研究也不排除实验验证，也需要经验素材，<u>哲学的经验素材就是我们人类都会有的那些一般性的经验</u>。科学研究所需的实验验证一定是大多数人都没经历过的特殊试验。</p><blockquote><p>巧者劳而知者忧，无能者无所求。饱食而遨游，泛若不系之舟，虚而遨游者也。——《列御寇篇》</p><p>物无非彼，物无非是。——《齐物论篇》</p><p>死生、存亡、穷达、贫富、贤与不肖、毁誉、饥渴、寒暑，是事之变、命之行也。——《德充符篇》</p></blockquote><p>庄子之道是自然之道，是“万物与我为一”的具体实现，上面的摘写反映了庄子对老子自然辨证思想的发展。<strong>自然辩证法</strong>作为马克思主义哲学中唯物辩证法的一种，反映客观事物运动发展的一般规律和普遍联系，是<strong>唯物主义辩证法在自然界中的具体化</strong>。狭义上来说，它也是科学技术的辩证法，是关于科学技术的研究方法和发展规律的哲学思考。</p><p>从自然辨证法的诞生可以看出它与科学的发展密不可分。在当时三个方面的重大变化和发展冲击着人们原有的自然图景和思维方式，为其创立提供了客观基础。表现如下:<strong>一是大机器生产带来的人类生产活动的高度社会化</strong>，加强了人们之间的社会联系和交往，改变着人们旧有保守的、静止和孤立的思维习惯和方法;<strong>二是自然科学的一系列伟大发现展现了自辩法发展的本性和规律</strong>，冲击着人们业已形成的机械的、形而上学的自然观:三是<u><strong>辩证唯物主义的创立为自然辩证法的创立提供了科学的理论基础</strong>，使自然观的革命有了理论指导。</u>自然辩证法就是在这种历史条件和诸多因素下,<u>辩证唯物主义哲学与自然科学和技术相结合的一场伟大的理论革命</u>。</p><p>自然辩证法揭示了自然科学发展的内在逻辑、人对自然界的能动关系等，建立了辩证唯物主义自然观、思想观点等，诸多体现具有划时代的变革。它不但把科学看作是一种独立的社会现象,探讨其在一定社会中发展和发挥作用的规律，而且也把与科学紧密相关的技术作为一种独立的社会现象来研究。</p><p>如此我们找到了答案：<strong>哲学为自然科学提供方法论，自然科学抛弃哲学形而上学的成分</strong>。</p><h2 id="三-现代视角下的庄子道家思想"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#三-现代视角下的庄子道家思想"></a> 三、现代视角下的庄子道家思想</h2><p>庄子思想以道为中心，主要分为<strong>道论</strong>和<strong>德论</strong>两个部分。庄子的道论包括“逍遥”境界和“齐物”之法。与道论紧密联系的是庄子的德论，德是道在现实层面的落实和体现。《庄子·德充符》曰：“知不可奈何而安之若命，唯有德者能之。”庄子的德论以安命思想为中心，以“用心若镜”和“与物为春”为其两翼。庄子的其他思想观念，诸如庄子的天人观、生死观、政治观、处世观、养生观等，都是在庄子道论和德论在不同方面的投射。[孙明君 2021]</p><h4 id="人生体验"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#人生体验"></a> 人生体验</h4><p>我相信我们每个人都有思考过自己的人生，不断探索并追求着自己的人生意义。在庄子眼里，<strong>人生是短促的</strong>，如《知北游》所说：“人生天地之间，若白驹之过隙，忽然而已”，让人联想到《古诗十九首》中的“人生天地间，忽如远行客”和“人生寄一世，奄乎若飙尘”；<strong>人生是梦幻的</strong>，在我们熟知的《齐物论》末，庄子梦为蝴蝶，醒后不知是庄周自己化为蝶，还是蝴蝶化为了庄周；人<strong>生也是痛苦的</strong>，如《齐物论》曰：“一受其成形，不忘以待尽。与物相刃相靡，其行尽如驰，而莫之能止，不亦悲乎！终身役役而不见其成功，苶然疲役而不知其所归，可不哀邪！人谓之不死，奚益！其形化，其心与之然，可不谓大哀乎？人之生也，固若是芒乎？其我独芒，而人亦有不芒者乎？”庄子连用了“不亦悲乎”“可不哀邪”“可不谓大哀乎”三个感叹句，对人生发出了沉重的叹息。</p><h4 id="人与自然"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#人与自然"></a> 人与自然</h4><p>今天我们所讨论的人与自然之关系，也即中国古代的<strong>天人关系</strong>。在先秦诸子中，道家最重视天人关系。道家学说中所论的“自然”并非我们所认为的大自然，而是自然而然的意思。我们所说的大自然，在老庄著述中是为“天地”。《齐物论》曰：“故其好之也一，其弗好之也一。其一也一，其不一也一。其一与天为徒，其不一与人为徒，天与人不相胜也，是之谓真人。”在中国哲学史上，庄子第一次明确提出了天人关系，天人关系也是庄子哲学的理论基石。自然源于道，人也源于道，二者息息相关。<u>人与自然本就是不可分割的一个整体</u>。人与自然是一个生命共同体，人类必须尊重自然、保护自然。在建设现代文明的今天，庄子的天人思想依然值得现代人加以借鉴。</p><h4 id="人与社会"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#人与社会"></a> 人与社会</h4><p>与儒家要求以积极进取的面貌示人不同，道家提出的是一种“<strong>虚以待物</strong>”的处世方式。庄子认为，人处世间，必须以顺应物情为要。庄子曰：“人皆知有用之用，而莫知无用之用。”“无用”之用正是“虚以待物”的体现。从历史上来看，儒家思想和道家思想，的确是两种完全不同的思想形态，但两者并非水火不容，更多的时候是以儒道互补的形式共存于世。《易传》曰：“一阴一阳之谓道。”儒道思想如同阴阳的对立统一体，共同构建了中国古代文化的思想体系。《孟子》曰：“达则兼济天下，穷则独善其身。”此处的独善其身与道家思想并不逆违。<u>在处世哲学上，古人往往向儒家思想学习，自强不息，厚德载物，但也常常把道家思想作为必要的补充。</u>面对逆境和挫折之时，道家的逍遥意识在某种程度上有助于古人消解焦虑、战胜自我，从而走出人生的困境。这种补充关系，也可值得今天的我们借鉴。</p><hr><p>参考文献：<br>[1]
